0. Common issues

	0.1 ID issues

		If you come across any IDs with imaging data but not any other assessment data in MAS records, you should be able to find explanation from the following table:

			Wave	|	MRI_ID	|	Explanation
		--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			1		|	2949	|	This participant was excluded from the MAS sample before 1st release of data.
			1		|	5586	|	This participant is not included in the MAS sample for analyses. Nicky Kochan's
					|			|	'special participant' - we are treating her as a MAS participant but we are not
					|			|	including her data in analyses.
			1		|	5806	|	Excluded after baseline data was originally released.
			1		|	6373	|	Excluded after baseline data was originally released.
			2		|	0094	|	From scanner2 and excluded from release.

	0.2 Scanner issues

		There is a scanner change in the middle of MAS Wave 1 MRI data acquisition. Please ask CHeBA Data Bank for the spreadsheet of scanner, and include as a dummy variable in your analyses if MAS Wave 1 data are used.

1. Cortical Thickness/volume/area from FreeSurfer

	1.1 Numbers

	1.2 Scanning parameters of T1w images

	1.3 Quality control

		FreeSurfer results have been visually checked to assure quality. This is through applying ENIGMA Cortical Quality Control Protocol 2.0 (Ref : http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-protocols/). For description, refer to section 1.5 Citations.

	1.4 FreeSurfer version

		The latest FreeSurfer version 7.1.0 (as of June 2020) was used for cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation.

	1.5 Citations

		The following paragrah should be added to the 'Method' section of your manuscript to describe FreeSurfer reconstruction and quality control on FreeSurfer results (Ref : https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurferMethodsCitation)

		'Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation was performed with FreeSurfer v7.1.0 [doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.021]. Briefly, --==TBC==--'

	1.6 Results

		You are most likely to be interested in cortical thickness, area and volume on left and right hemisphere. Note that it is NOT recommended to use subcortical volumes from *.aseg.volume or *.aseg.volume.etiv_perc, as these results are often inaccurate (Ref : https://bookdown.org/u0243256/tbicc/freesurfer.html#volume-in-mm3). Please use volumes in Section '2. Volumes of subcortical grey matter structures and their substructures'. For filenaming convention, take OATS Wave 1,2,3 cross-sectional outputs as an example:

		*.aseg.volume

			Subcortical grey matter volumes. This spreadsheet also includes volumes of large ROIs, e.g. brain soft tissue (BrainSegVolNotVent), cortex, total grey matter, etc. Intracranial volume (ICV; listed as 'EstimatedTotalIntraCranialVol' in the last column) can also be found in this spreadsheet.

		*.aparc.volume.rh.aparc and *.aparc.volume.lh.aparc

			Volumes of cortical ROIs in right/left hemisphere.

		*.aparc.thickness.rh.aparc and *.aparc.thickness.lh.aparc

			Mean thickness of cortical ROIs in right/left hemisphere.

		*.aparc.area.rh.aparc and *.aparc.area.lh.aparc

			Areas of cortical ROIs in right/left hemisphere.

		*.aparc

			Using standard parcellation scheme (68 ROIs; Desikan-Killiany atlas)

		*.aparc.a2009s

			Same measure (e.g. volume) with a finer parcellation scheme (148 ROIs; Destrieux atlas)

		*.etiv_perc

			Same as the file with filename without '.etiv_perc', but volumes are standardised (i.e. presented as percent ICV).

		*.aseg.wm_vol and *.aseg.wm_vol.etiv_perc

			Regional white matter volumes. In ‘recon-all -aurorecon3’, the command ‘mri_aparc2aseg’ is invoked with the flag ‘—hypo-as-wm’ (Ref : https://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/docs/tarballs_for_courses/FreeSurferTutorial-2012.pdf) which based on the help message means ‘label hypointensities as WM’. This ‘mri_aparc2seg’ command outputs wmparc.mgz file, and the wm vol was extracted from wmparc.stats (using ‘asegstats2table –stats wmparc.stats’). Therefore, WM vol in these files should include hypointense regions.


	1.7 Lobar volumes

		If you are interested in lobar volumes, you can sum volumes of ROIs belonging to the corresponding lobe. In Desikan-Killiany atlas (i.e. in *.aparc.volume.lh.aparc and *.aparc.volume.rh.aparc, not *.aparc.volume.lh.aparc.a2009s or *.aparc.volume.rh.aparc.a2009s), the mapping of individual ROIs is listed below (Ref : https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CorticalParcellation):

		Frontal
			Superior Frontal
			Rostral and Caudal Middle Frontal
			Pars Opercularis, Pars Triangularis, and Pars Orbitalis
			Lateral and Medial Orbitofrontal
			Precentral
			Paracentral
			Frontal Pole
		Parietal
			Superior Parietal
			Inferior Parietal
			Supramarginal
			Postcentral
			Precuneus
		Temporal
			Superior, Middle, and Inferior Temporal
			Banks of the Superior Temporal Sulcus
			Fusiform
			Transverse Temporal
			Entorhinal
			Temporal Pole
			Parahippocampal
		Occipital
			Lateral Occipital
			Lingual
			Cuneus
			Pericalcarine
		Cingulate (if you want to include in a lobe)
			Rostral Anterior (Frontal)
			Caudal Anterior (Frontal)
			Posterior (Parietal)
			Isthmus (Parietal)

	1.8 Lobar average thickness

		Mean thickness of lobes CANNOT be achieved by simply averaging the mean thickness of the ROIs associated to a lobe, as ROIs are not of the same size. Instead, area should be added as a weighting factor in calculating mean thickness of lobes (Ref : https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/UserContributions/FAQ#Q.Iamtryingtomeasuretheglobalmeancorticalthickness.28i.ecombinedacrosshemispheres.29.HowwouldIdothis.3F).

		lobar.thickness = [(ROI_1.thickness * ROI_1.area) + (ROI_2.thickness * ROI_2.area) + ... + (ROI_N.thickness * ROI_N.area)] / (ROI_1.area + ROI_2.area + ... + ROI_N.area)

	1.9 Global white matter volume

		Volumes of lhCerebralWhiteMatter/rhCerebralWhiteMatter/CerebralWhiteMatter includes hypointensite voxels on T1w (also known as white matter hyperintensities and white matter lesions), but do not include cerebellar white matter or brainstem.

2. Volumes of subcortical grey matter structures and their substructures

	Subcortical grey matter volumes in this section should be used, instead of *.aseg.volume or *.aseg.volume.etic_perc (Ref : https://bookdown.org/u0243256/tbicc/freesurfer.html#volume-in-mm3).
