	1.2 Scanning parameters

		TO-DO : fill in T1w scanning parameters.

	1.3 Issue with data

		None

	1.4 FreeSurfer

		FreeSurfer's recon-all was applied to quantify cortical measures, including
		cortical thickness, area, volume, etc.

		1.4.1 FreeSurfer version

			FreeSurfer version 7.1.0 was used. To be specific, freesurfer-linux-centos7_x86_64-7.1.0-20200511-813297b.

		1.4.2 recon-all options

			Multiple combinations of recon-all options were tested to seek optimal outcome
			from recon-all. These include:

				recon-all -s <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -all
				recon-all -s <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -wsatlas -all #use atlas for skull stripping
				recon-all -s <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -bigventricles -all
				antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh -d 3 -f <t1_nifti> -m <flair_nifti> -o <inplaneFLAIR> -t a ; recon-all -subjid <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -FLAIR <inplaneFLAIR> -FLAIRpial -all #use FLAIR to improve pial surface reconstruction

			Results showed that 

				1) skull stripping using atlas (-wsatlas) slightly improved brain extraction results.
				2) benefit from adding '-bigventricles' was minimal
				3) adding FLAIR messed up pial surface reconstruction. This is likely due to the loose FLAIR acquisition resolution (0.8*0.8*3.5). Ref = https://www.mail-archive.com/freesurfer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/msg63099.html. With an isotropic FLAIR acquisition, FLAIR is demonstrated to significantly improve the quality of pial surface reconstruction.

			Therefore, MAS, OATS and SCS FreeSurfer recon-all processing was carried out with the following command:

				recon-all -s <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -wsatlas -all

		1.4.3 recon-all failure not salvageable

			1.4.3.1 MAS

				Seven MAS scans were not salvageable: 1494_w1,1493_w2,0699_w2,2851_w1,2851_w4,6420_w4,2007_w4

				These failures are due to hitting walltime on Gadi cluster which is 48 hours. The reason for the excessive long run is that there are multiple defects to be fixed. FreeSurfer suggested that such defect fixing is taking long time and highly prone to errors.

			1.4.3.2 OATS

				None

			1.4.3.3 SCS

				TO DO

		1.4.4 Quality control

			1.4.4.1 QC procedures

				ENIGMA Cortical Quality Control Protocol 2.0 (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-protocols/) was applied for quality control of recon-all results. Briefly,

					1) identify subjects with cortical thickness and surface area values that deviate from the rest of your subjects
					2) internal surface QC - display slices showing segmentation of cortical ROIs
					3) external surface QC - display pial surface on 3D brains.

		TO-DO : optiBET processing of some T1w images results in errors. This is to be examined.

2. Diffusion-weighted imaging

	2.1 Numbers

		N (MW1 dwi nifti) = 539
		N (MW2 dwi nifti) = 423
		N (MW4 dwi nifti) = 264

	2.2 Scanning parameters

		TO-DO : fill in DWI scanning parameters.

	2.2 Issue with data

		2.2.1 Missing bvec for some MW1 DWI scans

			Some MW1 DWI scans missed bvecs. Since MW1 DWI has only 6 gradient directions, they are not likely to be used in studies. Therefore, efforts have not been put to salvage these scans.

		2.2.2 Flipped bvec in MW2 DWI scans

			The first dimension (along x-axis) of MW2 DWI scans was found to be flipped. The sign of the first dimension needs to be inversed.

			TO-DO : check whether MW4 has the same issue.

	2.3 MRtrix3 and FSL

		2.3.1 mrtrix

			MRtrix is used as the main software package to process dwi with FSL's eddy_cuda for preprocessing (see Section 2.3.2). MRtrix processing includes:

				dwidenoise -force -noise noise.mif in.mif dwidenoise.mif
				mrdegibbs -force -axes 0,1 dwidenoise.mif mrdegibbs.mif
				mrconvert -force -export_grad_fsl bvec bval mrdegibbs.mif mrdegibbs.nii.gz

				mrdegibbs.nii.gz, bvec, and bval are then used in FSL's eddy_cuda (see Section 2.3.2.1).

		2.3.2 fsl

			eddy_cuda was applied to dwi data that have gone through MRtrix's dwidenoise and mrdegibbs.

			2.3.2.1 eddy_cuda options

				--slm linear

					MW4 has more than 60 directions, but the vectors do not cover the whole sphere.

		N (MW4 rsBOLD) = 252
		N (SCS rsBOLD) = 71

	3.2 Scanning parameters

	3.3 Issue with data

		3.3.1 spatial resolution

		3.3.2 inconsistent number of volumes

			MW24_cross-sectional has 208 volumes. In OW2_cross-sectional, 31065 has 180 volumes before removing the first 5 volumes. All Queensland scans have 216 volumes. Otherwise, all 208 volumes.

	3.4 Preprocessing

		3.4.1 fMRIPrep

			Standard fMRIprep v1.5.5 commands were conducted with singularity image:

				  singularity run --cleanenv \
				                -B ${BIDS_dir}:/data \
				                -B ${BIDS_dir}/derivatives/fmriprep/${fmriprep_version}:/out \
				                -B ${BIDS_dir}/derivatives/fmriprep/${fmriprep_version}/work:/work \
				                /data2/jiyang/mySingulateImgs/fmriprep-${fmriprep_version}.simg \
				                /data /out \
				                participant \
				                --participant_label ${subjID} \
				                --fs-license-file ${fs_license} \
				                --work-dir /work \
				                --ignore {fieldmaps,slicetiming} \
				                --output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:res-2 MNI152NLin2009cAsym \
				                --skip_bids_validation

			In addition to fMRIprep v1.5.5, the following steps were also conducted:

				  1) nuisance regression (csf, wm, 6 motion params)
				  2) FWHM = 6 mm
				  3) bandpass (0.009 - 0.08 Hz)
				  4) removing the first 5 volumes

			Preprocessed fMRI are stored at /data2/public on NiL.
