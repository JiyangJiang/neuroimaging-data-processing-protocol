1. T1-weighted scans

	1.1 Numbers (after removing bad-quality scans)

		N (MW124 raw T1) = 1,227

		N (MW1 raw T1)   = 541
		N (MW2 raw T1)   = 424
		N (MW4 raw T1)   = 262

		N (MW12 raw T1)  = 146 pairs
		N (MW14 raw T1)  = 28 pairs
		N (MW24 raw T1)  = 31 pairs
		N (MW124 raw T1) = 200 pairs *

		* Subjects with all three time points (MW124) were first picked before looking for two time points (e.g. MW12, MW14, or MW24).

	1.2 Scanning parameters

		TO-DO : fill in T1w scanning parameters.

	1.3 Issue with data

		None

	1.4 FreeSurfer

		FreeSurfer's recon-all was applied to quantify cortical measures, including
		cortical thickness, area, volume, etc.

		1.4.1 FreeSurfer version

			FreeSurfer version 7.1.0 was used. To be specific, freesurfer-linux-centos7_x86_64-7.1.0-20200511-813297b.

		1.4.2 recon-all options

			Multiple combinations of recon-all options were tested to seek optimal outcome
			from recon-all. These include:

				recon-all -s <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -all
				recon-all -s <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -wsatlas -all #use atlas for skull stripping
				recon-all -s <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -bigventricles -all
				antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh -d 3 -f <t1_nifti> -m <flair_nifti> -o <inplaneFLAIR> -t a ; recon-all -subjid <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -FLAIR <inplaneFLAIR> -FLAIRpial -all #use FLAIR to improve pial surface reconstruction

			Results showed that 

				1) skull stripping using atlas (-wsatlas) slightly improved brain extraction results.
				2) benefit from adding '-bigventricles' was minimal
				3) adding FLAIR messed up pial surface reconstruction. This is likely due to the loose FLAIR acquisition resolution (0.8*0.8*3.5). Ref = https://www.mail-archive.com/freesurfer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/msg63099.html. With an isotropic FLAIR acquisition, FLAIR is demonstrated to significantly improve the quality of pial surface reconstruction.

			Therefore, MAS, OATS and SCS FreeSurfer recon-all processing was carried out with the following command:

				recon-all -s <subj> -i <t1_nifti> -wsatlas -all

		1.4.3 recon-all failure not salvageable

		1.4.4 Quality control

			ENIGMA Cortical Quality Control Protocol 2.0 (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-protocols/) was applied for quality control of recon-all results. Briefly,

				1) identify subjects with cortical thickness and surface area values that deviate from the rest of your subjects
				2) internal surface QC - display slices showing segmentation of cortical ROIs
				3) external surface QC - display pial surface on 3D brains.

		1.4.5 Longitudinal pipeline

		1.4.6 Hippocampal subfields and nuclei of amygdala

				NOT DONE YET.

			1.4.6.3 using other MRI modalities

				Subfield volumes can also be calculated using other MRI modalities (e.g. DWI or fMRI) using vol2subfield. See Section 6 Multimodal integration at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/HippocampalSubfieldsAndNucleiOfAmygdala.

				NOT DONE YET.

		1.4.7 Brainstem substructures

			1.4.7.1 using T1w only

				Four brainstem substructures are segmented from T1w: medulla oblongata, pons, midbrain, and superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP). Ref : https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/BrainstemSubstructures

					segmentBS.sh <subj> <SUBJECTS_DIR>

	1.5 fsl

		1.5.1 fsl_anat

			fsl_anat with default settings was run on all T1w data

				fsl_anat -i <t1_nifti>
				
	1.6 ANTs

	1.7 optiBET

		optiBET was run on all T1w scans with default parameters for brain extraction:

			optiBET.sh -i <t1_nifti>

			Ref : https://montilab.psych.ucla.edu/fmri-wiki/optibet/

		TO-DO : optiBET processing of some T1w images results in errors. This is to be examined.

	1.8 acpcdetect

		Default acpcdetect command was run on raw T1w.

			acpcdetect -i <t1_nifti>

2. Diffusion-weighted imaging

	2.1 Numbers

		N (MW1 dwi nifti) = 539
		N (MW2 dwi nifti) = 423
		N (MW4 dwi nifti) = 264

	2.2 Scanning parameters

		TO-DO : fill in DWI scanning parameters.

	2.2 Issue with data

		2.2.1 Missing bvec for some MW1 DWI scans

			Some MW1 DWI scans missed bvecs. Since MW1 DWI has only 6 gradient directions, they are not likely to be used in studies. Therefore, efforts have not been put to salvage these scans.

		2.2.2 Flipped bvec in MW2 DWI scans

			The first dimension (x-dimension) of MW2 DWI scans was found to be flipped. The sign of the first dimension needs to be inversed.

			TO-DO : check whether MW4 has the same issue.

		2.3.2 fsl
